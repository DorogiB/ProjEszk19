Missing/faulty implementations:
 * Project members/contributors can be added, but could not be deleted from a project.
 * The "open/closed project" feature is not yet implemented.
 * The user's personal data section is imperfect/faulty:
    - "noname" skills can be added (backend error).
    - password could not be changed.
    - same skills can be added multiple times (frontend error).
 * Required skills can not be added to the project.
   (Frontend interface is done, but not working. May be only a frontend bug.)
 * Tasks in "in progress" state can be deleted.
   (Both backend and frontend error. Tasks marked as "done" might be affected on the backend as well.)
 * On the project members page, even the user's own projects are listed as "participating".

Unit tests:
source: https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-run-unit-test-with-maven/

# Run all the unit test classes.
$ mvn test

-In the directory structure there should be a brand different bracket for the tests.
-One test file ragarding the tests for specific methods is sufficient.
